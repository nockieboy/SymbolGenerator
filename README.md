# SymbolGenerator
A simple 8x16 symbol generator for 8-bit systems.

Symbol Generator is a simple tool to make it easy to create new symbols (characters) for 8x16 character sets.

It is geared around 8-bit systems where each row of the character/symbol is represented by a single byte.  By providing a basic
editor in the window where you can enable/disable pixels as desired, the program updates the values for each row and even provides
a comma-separated accumulated output for copy-pasting into your application of choice.

This is open source software, not particularly spectactularly programmed, but it was written to fulfill a simple purpose, and that it does. :)
